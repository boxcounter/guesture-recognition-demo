# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a gesture recognition project. The codebase is currently in early stages with minimal structure.

## Development Commands

The project uses Python. Standard Python commands apply:

```bash
# Run the main application
python main.py

# Run with Python 3 explicitly
python3 main.py
```

## Architecture

The project currently consists of:
- `main.py` - Entry point for the application (currently empty)

As the project develops, update this section with:
- Core modules and their responsibilities
- Data flow patterns
- Key architectural decisions
- Integration points with external libraries (e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
